# LINE-FOLLOWER
Overview
            A Line Follower Robot is an autonomous robot that follows a predefined path, usually marked by a black line on a white surface or vice versa. This project uses sensors to detect the line and control motors to follow the path efficiently.

Features
        Autonomous navigation along a marked path
        Real-time line detection using IR sensors
        Smooth speed control for efficient movement
        Ability to handle curves and intersections
